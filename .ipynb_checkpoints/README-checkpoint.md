## README

This Jupyter notebook was created from a BootCamp class hosted by the Ahrens in HHMI Janelia (tutors Takashi Kawashima and Mika Rubinov). The goal of this class is to learn the basics of data analysis for large-scale calcium imaging experiments. In our experiment, calcium activities of ~100,000 neurons were simuntaneously recorded from brains of larval zebrafish, behaving in a virtual reality environment [ref 1-3].
